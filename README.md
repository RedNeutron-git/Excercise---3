Simple md5 bruteforce hash tool
This tool can be used as a bruteforce attack (ethical purpose) on the md5 hash, or you can modify it to be able to perform a bruteforce attack on another hash. Basically, the bruteforce attack uses the continuous trial-and-error method to explore them decisively. Happy experimenting!

## Require Python 2
**Linux or MacOS**
```sh
apt install python
```
**Windows**
```sh
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2718/

    md5 hash: 88006a6cdf469ab05525824f9c2c3759
    wordlist: wordlist.txt
    
    You got it: trycrackme!
```

> Note: `wordlist.txt` the only sample, you can use the other wordlist.
